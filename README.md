# LIQUIDATION WITH TEMPORARY AND PERMANENT PRICE IMPACT
## About
In high-frequency trading, an agent may use market orders to liquidate shares with both temporary and permanent price impact, but this can be a challenging task due to the speed and complexity of the market.
A market order is an order to buy or sell a security at the current market price. It is the simplest and fastest way to execute a trade, but it can also result in significant price impact if there is not enough liquidity in the market to absorb the order.
To liquidate shares with both temporary and permanent price impact, an agent must carefully balance the speed and size of their market orders to minimize market impact and achieve the desired execution price. This can involve using sophisticated algorithms and trading strategies to analyze market conditions and adjust trading parameters in real-time.
